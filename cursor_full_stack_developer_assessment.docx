I'll help you build this CSV Manager application using the OpenSaaS framework. Let's break this down into manageable steps and start with the initial setup.

First, let's check if we have a workspace initialized and set up the OpenSaaS project.

I see we already have an OpenSaaS project initialized. Let's first check the database schema to see what we need to add for our CSV management functionality.

Great! I see that the schema already has the required models for our CSV management functionality. Now let's check if we have the necessary UI components and pages set up.

Let's first check if we have the required dependencies installed for our project.

I see we have most of the required dependencies. Let's create the CSV Manager page and its components. First, let's create the CSV Manager page.

```typescriptreact
import { CsvManager } from "@/components/csv-manager/CsvManager";

export default function CsvManagerPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">CSV Manager</h1>
      <CsvManager />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now let's create the CsvManager component. We'll need to create a few components:
1. CsvManager (main component)
2. FileUploader (drag & drop component)
3. FileList (list of uploaded files)
4. CsvTable (Notion-like table view)

Let's start with the CsvManager component:

```typescriptreact
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { FileUploader } from './FileUploader';
import { FileList } from './FileList';
import { CsvTable } from './CsvTable';
import { CsvFile } from '@prisma/client';

export function CsvManager() {
  const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState<CsvFile | null>(null);

  return (
    <div className="space-y-8">
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
        <div className="md:col-span-1 space-y-6">
          <FileUploader />
          <FileList onFileSelect={setSelectedFile} selectedFile={selectedFile} />
        </div>
        <div className="md:col-span-2">
          {selectedFile ? (
            <CsvTable csvFile={selectedFile} />
          ) : (
            <div className="border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-gray-500">
              Select a CSV file to view and edit its contents
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now let's create the FileUploader component with drag & drop functionality:

```typescriptreact
'use client';

import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';
import { Upload } from 'lucide-react';
import { toast } from 'sonner';

export function FileUploader() {
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);

  const onDrop = useCallback(async (acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];
    if (!file) return;

    if (!file.name.endsWith('.csv')) {
      toast.error('Please upload a CSV file');
      return;
    }

    setIsUploading(true);
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/csv/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Upload failed');
      }

      toast.success('File uploaded successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error('Failed to upload file');
      console.error('Upload error:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsUploading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      'text/csv': ['.csv'],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
  });

  return (
    <div
      {...getRootProps()}
      className={`
        border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8 text-center transition-colors
        ${isDragActive ? 'border-blue-500 bg-blue-50' : 'border-gray-300'}
        ${isUploading ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed' : 'cursor-pointer hover:border-blue-500'}
      `}
    >
      <input {...getInputProps()} disabled={isUploading} />
      <Upload className="w-12 h-12 mx-auto mb-4 text-gray-400" />
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
        {isDragActive
          ? 'Drop the CSV file here'
          : isUploading
          ? 'Uploading...'
          : 'Drag & drop a CSV file here, or click to select'}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We need to install some additional dependencies. Let's install them:

---

**User**

is this code correct :
import { CsvManager } from "@/components/csv-manager/CsvManager";

export default function CsvManagerPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">CSV Manager</h1>
      <CsvManager />
    </div>
  );
}

---

**Cursor**

Yes, the code structure for the CSV Manager page is correct, but we need to make one small modification. Since this is a client-side component that will handle user interactions, we should add the 'use client' directive at the top of the file.

Let me update the file:

```typescriptreact
'use client';

import { CsvManager } from "@/components/csv-manager/CsvManager";

export default function CsvManagerPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">CSV Manager</h1>
      <CsvManager />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now the code is fully correct. Here's why each part is important:

1. `'use client'` - This directive tells Next.js that this component should be rendered on the client side, which is necessary because we'll be handling user interactions and state.

2. `import { CsvManager } from "@/components/csv-manager/CsvManager"` - This imports our main CsvManager component using the `@/` alias which points to the root of our project.

3. The component structure:
   - Uses a container with auto margins (`container mx-auto`)
   - Has proper padding (`py-8`)
   - Contains a heading with appropriate styling (`text-3xl font-bold mb-8`)
   - Renders the CsvManager component which will handle all the CSV management functionality

The import path `@/components/csv-manager/CsvManager` is correct assuming you have the following directory structure:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ csv-manager/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â””â”€â”€ csv-manager/
        â””â”€â”€ CsvManager.tsx
```

The linter error about not finding the CsvManager module will be resolved once we have all the components properly created and the dependencies installed.

```plaintext
/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ csv-manager/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â””â”€â”€ csv-manager/
        â””â”€â”€ CsvManager.tsx
```

clear the error inside the page.tsx  app\csv-manager  give the updated full code

**Cursor**

Let me check the current code and fix the import path error. First, let's verify the component's location:

Let's update the page.tsx with the correct import path:

```typescriptreact
'use client';

import { CsvManager } from "../../components/csv-manager/CsvManager";

export default function CsvManagerPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">CSV Manager</h1>
      <CsvManager />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The code is now updated with the correct relative import path. Here's why this works:

1. We changed from `@/components/...` to `../../components/...` because:
   - The file is in `app/csv-manager/page.tsx`
   - To reach the root directory from there, we need to go up two levels (`../../`)
   - Then we can access the components directory

The full code is now:
```typescript
'use client';

import { CsvManager } from "../../components/csv-manager/CsvManager";

export default function CsvManagerPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">CSV Manager</h1>
      <CsvManager />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This should resolve the import error. The relative path is more reliable in this case as it doesn't depend on path aliases being correctly configured in the TypeScript config.

Let me verify if the CsvManager component exists in the correct location:

```typescript
'use client';

import { CsvManager } from "../../components/csv-manager/CsvManager";

export default function CsvManagerPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">CSV Manager</h1>
      <CsvManager />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Perfect! The files are in the correct location and the import path is now properly set up. The code should work without any import errors.
